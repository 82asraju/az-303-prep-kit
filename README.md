## Exam preparation tips

### #1: Understand exam structure

Az-300 is focusing on practical usecases of Azure technologies. Exam has following characteristics:

1. Questions: 40-60 questions

   * Some questions are worth 1 point

   * Some questions cannot be skipped

   * There are different types of questions: multiple-choice, build list, hot area, drag and drop, reorder etc

   * There are also Performance based questions (labs) to be done in Azure portal

   * Questions are often in context of Case Studies where you need to gather and understand information across multiple sources

2. Duration: 3,5 hours

   * Schedule 30 minutes for reading and understangin instructions and rest for actal exam.

### #2: Learn how to manipulate resources on Azure using command line tools

* Use `az interactive` to enable CLI auto completion and helpful tips

* Use `powershell`, get help on commands and understand the order of command-lets (first create resource group, etc)

### #3: Preview features are NOT included in the exam curriculum

### #4: Always answer all the questions. There is no penalty for wrong answers

### #5: Before you schedule the exam, check for offers

### #6: Practice key components using Azure portal, there will be practice tests

* [Create free account on Azure and practice!](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

### #7: Schedule exam and create and follow preparation plan

When I was confident I have enought preparation and understand the material, it was time to **schedule the exam**.
Scheduling exam was important to set a date in calendar and make sure I stay focus and plan my time well.

**10 days** from exam I scheduled final preparation plan focusing on each section as follows:

* Days 1-2: Deploy and configure infrastructure (25-30%)

* Days 3-4: Implement workloads and security (20-25%)

* Day 5: Create and deploy apps (5-10%)

* Day 6: Implement authentication and secure data (5-10%)

* Days 7-8: Develop for the cloud and for Azure storage (20-25%)

* Day 9: Microsoft Azure AZ-300 Architecture Technologies Practice Exams (bought cheap on Udemy during Cyber Week)

* Day 10: EXAM!

**Good luck :)**
